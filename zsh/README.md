# zsh dotfile

basically just install [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and set the terminal to use a powerline-capable [font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) (i think most of the [nerdfonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) should work as well)


the basicest of the aliases are set, also nvm lazy load so that it doesn't slow down the shell startup time
